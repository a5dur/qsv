# csv,conf,v8-2024 logos

To break the ice during my talk at csv,conf,v8-2024, I decided to create fun, conference-themed logos using ChatGPT 4o.

These logos were generated by providing the original qsv logo to ChatGPT 4o and asking it to generate a new logo based on the original. The results are quite interesting and were generated using the following prompt sequence:

**Original qsv logo**:

   ![Original qsv logo](../qsv-logo.png)
   > Can you modify the logo so the rider looks like Speedy Gonzales? 

**Logo 1**:

   ![Logo 1](qsv-ai-logo1.png)
   > Keep the general outline of the logo. Also, make it look like the cartoon character "Speedy Gonzales"  

**Logo 2**:

   ![Logo 2](qsv-ai-logo2.png)
   > Please create another version that looks more like the original. This time, only change the rider so it looks like the Looney Tunes cartoon character "Speedy Gonzales"

**Logo 3**:

   > Nice! Can you correct the spelling of "CSSV DATAWANGLLER" and change it to "CSV DATAWRANGLER"?

**Logo 4**:
   ![Logo 4](qsv-ai-logo4.png)
   > It's still mispelled!

**Logo 5 & 6**:  
   Somehow, it generated two logos for the last prompt. It first generated Logo 5, and as I was typing that it was still mispelled, it generated Logo 6 unprompted!  
   Here they are:
   ![Logo 5](qsv-ai-logo5.png)
   ![Logo 6](qsv-ai-logo6.png)

My favorites are Logo 3 and 5. Which one do you like the most?
